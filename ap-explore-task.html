        <p>2a<br> The innovation I chose was The Ibm Watson supercomputer. The purpose of the Watson computer is, it is a computer answering machine that researches its answers. It works by Having access to 200 million pages of data. This artifact shows
            the basis of what the Ibm is, a computer that is also Artificial intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>2b<br> I used a program named GIMP to create my Artifact. So for my Artifact I choose three photos to represent Watson, the first photo was about the Artificial intelligence that the company who made Watson, IBM uses to Represent Watsons Knowledge.
            The second photo i chose was about the Computer itself the 3 photo was the Avatar they used to show what Watson is, for all of the photos i scaled each to fit on the artifact.

        <p> 2c<br> A recent Innovation would be a supercomputer named Watson, Watson is a question answering computer system capable of answering questions and collecting data. The purpose of the Watson computer is In most cases, the roles Watson is supposedly
            taking on involve applying some version of machine learning in a novel area. For example, IBM has bought up medical image databases and is using deep learning to try to help doctors spot diseases more rapidly(1). A benefit of the Watson computer
            would be that since the Watson computer can collect and answer data it can research for important ideas like ways on curing cancer. A potential harm would be the cost of the computer itself, supercomputers cost millions of dollars to make
            and then a significant amount of time would be consumed by the people who are coding The Watson computer. A Beneficial impact on society is the computer learning more information over time so it could help people who have Irreversible problems
            with health and Cancer patients. The Impact of this innovation overtime is since it learns it will help many humans with health issues in the long run.
        </p>
        <p> 2D<br> The Watson innovation collects Medical Health data Using Books and References. The Watson processes 200 million pages of documents, including dictionaries, encyclopedias, it uses 100 algorithms, identifying any names, dates or other entities
            regarding what it is looking for (2). The watson processes the data into answers about Medical and Business questions. The Watson Data Platform features embedded, cognitive-assisted machine learning. It provides user-specific tools and data
            (3). A storage concern about Watson would be that, The Watson is not connected to the internet and since the computer is fed data through various documents, the data that the Watson is given could be wrong which could lead to the wrong information
            that would be given out. The wrong information could be taking storage space for actual storage. This is a concern because doctors and business people can rely on the information that is given to them false information to Patients or Clients.
