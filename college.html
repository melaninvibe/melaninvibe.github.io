        <h2 class>College Goals</h2>
        <p>So my GPA at the moment is a 2.5, To get to where i want to go is a 3.6 and above. For me to focus i just need a drive and by drive i mean a will to work for what i want to do in life. Ive taken the ACT and i didnt do so bad on it but ive could
            have done a lot better on trying. I can acheive the 3.6 by taking Honors classes and doing what my nanny says and getting extra credit for my struggling classes </p>

        <p class="Colleges">Location; Bethleham, Pennsylvania</p>
        <p class="Colleges">Gpa:3.8</p>

        <p class="Colleges">Major:Computer Science and Business Program (Und.)</p>
        <p>I would enjoy to resume my education at this institute because of one thing and that is For the major CS and Busines, Its two things i'd like to persure when im older and instead of choosing just one id be able to do both. The campus is very regal
            and appealing. It's very diffrent from California in many ways. it is on the east coast and in a religous city. Im black if you havent noticed and Lehigh is clearly not tailored towrds me in any way but going there would surpass sterotypes
            and fulfill my dream of going there. Of course i know that gpa at the moment is not stable enough to attend but that just means id have to work harder to go there.

        </p>

        <p class="Colleges">Gpa:3.21</p>
        <p class="Colleges">Location:Arcata,Ca </p>
        <p class="Colleges">Major:Computer Science(Und.)</p>
        <p>I don't want to go to humbolt because of the scenery, it is very green and earthly. I may be from a city but do want to get away from here. Im intrested in looking at it. It would basically be a culture shock to me if i did end up going to humblot.
            The major CS is alright there but,it not up with Berkley and or MIT. and i wouldn't learn much there i believe.

        <h3 class="Colleges"> <img src="Southern.png" width=200 height=70 class="picture" /> </h3>
        <p class="Colleges">Location:Baton Rouge, Location</p>
        <p class="Colleges">Major:Buisness</p>
        <p class="Colleges">GPA:2.0</p>
        <p class="Colleges">Southern University is a historical black college</p>
        <p>I want to go to southern to get to know my roots a bit more. The campus life is a ofcourse great because of the 'Black' Greek organizations that are there "and national organizations, the Office of Student Life challenges and educates students
            in the areas of integrity, commitment, accountability, leadership, scholarship, and civic responsibility. Southern University and A&M College recognizes that Greek-letter organizations are an integral part of the campus community and can have
            a positive impact for members and the campus community as a whole". i want to become a delta once i get there because of there dedication to education, It's a group of black women up lifting eachother in a society where everything is against
            them. I attend a Prodominatly latino highschool and if i go to a PWI i wont be able to be around people like me. Buisness would be great there to me because there are many jobs i'd be able to do if i went into that field. </p>
